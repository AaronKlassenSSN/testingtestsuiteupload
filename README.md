# testingtestsuiteupload

This project requires Selenium and TestNG to properly use in Eclipse, and Maven to run from command line.

Very easy to set up.  Clone the project on your local machine and import it into Eclipse.  You may need to import dependencies like Maven and TestNG.  Once imported and the build path is configured, tests can be run using the RunSeleniumTests.bat file.
